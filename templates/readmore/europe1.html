        <h2>A taste of Italy – Ghost towns & Italian food!</h2><br>
        <p>Our road trip along the French Riviera continues as we pick it up in Monaco! We make a few more stops in Eze and Menton, and then it’s off to Italy!

           <br><br> This was Matt’s first time in Italy, but we only had enough time for a short stay. We had such a fun time exploring the former ghost town of Bussana Vecchia. This ancient town was abandonded after a massive earthquake in 1887, but has since been renovated and repopulated by a community of artists who have taken up residence. It’s unlike any other place I’ve ever visited before and definitely worth a visit if you’re in the area.
            
           <br><br> We final night of the road trip was spent in the beautiful seaside city of Imperia. I could’ve spent a few more days here relaxing on the beaches, strolling the boardwalks, and exploring all the shops and restaurants. It was such a perfect ending to our trip to be watching the sunset from the seaside while finally getting a taste of that delicious Italian gelato!</p>
